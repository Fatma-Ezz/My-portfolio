      <p>Hi! I'm Fatma, a frontend developer. You might be wondering, "How does one make that leap?" Well, while perfecting the art of emulsification, I discovered that my true passion lies in the world of code.

Now, instead of whipping up culinary wonders, I'm cooking up clean, efficient code and deliciously interactive websites.</p>
